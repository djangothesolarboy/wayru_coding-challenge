Objectives:
---
- Website built in React, plus with Redux.
- The site should have a set of basic styles, plus use of SCSS.
- The site must be deployed with a server-less infrastructure that consumes at least one backend endpoint, in one of the following ways, to send an email to you and whoever uses the contact form with a copy of the data filled in the form:
    - In server-less functions. The use of TypeScript is considered a plus or, 
    - Backend API.
- The site shall do consistent error handling. For example, in the contact form, if a field is missing, or is filled with unexpected information (eg, a text instead of a number for a telephone field), the site should show the user why that field is not it has been filled out correctly. The use of TDD is rewarded.
